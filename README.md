GitHub Actions Docker Builds Visualization
==========================================

This project was inspired by one of my pull requests where I publish
[Hadoop Docker image to my DockerHub](https://github.com/QubitPi/hadoop/pull/2) and spotted
[Docker Builds data](https://github.com/QubitPi/hadoop/actions/runs/15796871290) by chance. 

The goal of this project is to research "on-click" visualization on
[Docker Builds](https://docker.qubitpi.org/desktop/use-desktop/builds/) combining

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/blog/new-beta-feature-deep-dive-into-github-actions-docker-builds-with-docker-desktop)
2. Jaeger
3. OpenTelemetry
